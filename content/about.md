Many years have pasted and so many memories have been stored in our human brains. Some photographs of these memories have also been stored on disks and drives of various formats, from floppies to thumbdrives. Here you'll find some of these photographs, sorted neatly in cateogries.

[Dyne.org](/) is a digital community and free software foundry. We share tools, practices and narratives that empower artists, creatives and citizens in the digital age.

We are a think-and-do tank, born as an online community in 1999 by uniting artists, activists and hackers of mixed backgrounds. We are also a research organisation working for the European Commission for a decade. These are our three guiding principles:

#### ü´Ä Diversity

We love to mix methods, disciplines, knowledge, culture and languages. We love our Bastard Culture!

#### üî¨ Open-source

Code is our literature: we build software to communicate, interact and inspire. Dyne.org is where art, science and technology meet open source.

#### ‚ôªÔ∏è Ecology

We recycle old technology rather than create needs for new ones: this is our way to respect the environment and optimise resources.

Many people and organisations in all fields employed and redistributed our creations. Our software gives everybody the right to use, study, share and improve its code, supporting fundamental freedoms.
